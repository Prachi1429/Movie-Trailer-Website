**MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE**
-------------------------

A server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including
box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then use the code to generate a
static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the
trailers.

### Requirements:

1.  Installation of Python. For downloading Python, Visit:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.  Basic knowledge of Python and HTML Syntax

### Attached Files:

1.  The file *fresh\_tomatoes.py* contains the *open\_movies\_page()*
    function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML
    file including this content, producing a website to showcase your
    favorite movies.
2.  In *media.py* a movie class is defined with the properties of a
    movie like: movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer
    URLs.
3.  A list of the movie objects is stored in *entertainment\_center.py*.
    By calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie
    objects we've given movies their own custom data structure by
    defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can
    be stored in a list data structure.

### Get to the Code and Check for Errors:

-   To obtain the code,right click on the file with .py extension and
    choose edit with IDLE.
-   To check for errors, press F5 or go to Run Menu and choose Run
